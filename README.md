# OSMD Audio player
Unoffical audio playback engine for [OpenSheetMusicDisplay](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay). Successor meant to replace my previous proof of concept player & demo at https://github.com/jimutt/osmd-playback-demo.  

This player is still in a very early state and lots of breaking and non-breaking changes will most likely be introduced before the first major release. 

**Vue JS Demo**: https://osmd-audio-player-vue.netlify.com/

Features:
- Framework agnostic, not tied to a specific front end Framework
- Multi-instrument support 
- Individual level controls
- Automatic tempo detection from score
- Automatic instrument assignment
- Written in Typescript for better DX for maintainers and users 

Roadmap: 
- Repeat support
- Dynamics support
- Grace note support
- Click to set playback position
- Demo projects with different frontend frameworks (currently there's only a very outdated and rough Vue.js demo)
- Quickstart guide & more extensive Readme
